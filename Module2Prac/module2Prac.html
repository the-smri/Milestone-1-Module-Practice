        <h3>The Early Life of a Seeker</h3>
        <p>
Pythagoras was born around 570 BCE on the Greek island of Samos. The son of a gem-engraver, he grew up in a world of trade and craftsmanship, but his interests lay in the deeper mysteries of the cosmos. According to ancient historians, Pythagoras was an insatiable student who traveled throughout Egypt, Chaldea, and Babylon. During these journeys, he is believed to have studied with the leading mathematicians and priests of the time, absorbing the esoteric knowledge of the Near East and the advanced geometry of the Egyptians.
